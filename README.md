To predict the survivors based on the guests' data

First, the usual data exploration approach
1) Cleaning the data & dealing with missing variables
2) Visualization of feature relations
3) Feature engineering

Then, I used two modelling approaches to do the training and predictions
1) fastai - tabular learner model
2) Stacking models
